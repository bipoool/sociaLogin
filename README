This Project consists of both frontend and backend

for frontEnd install node_modules using 
-> "cd ./frontEnd"
-> "npm i"

for backend install modules from requirement.txt
if needed also install django-cors-headers explicitly using
-> "python -m pip install django-cors-headers"

just need fast api and uvicorn to run

-> "pip install fastapi"
